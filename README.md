## Releaser

App release manager for Levpay's applications. Allows tagging versions without all the necessary cmding and editing.

## Dependancy

It strongly depends on `goreleaser` CLI to build your apps.

## Why

It allows us to release across multiple apps without the need of adding a `goreleaser.yml` file on each one of them.

## Install 

```
    $ go get -v github.com/levpay/releaser
```
